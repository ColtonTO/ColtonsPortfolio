# Colton's Portfolio

## https://coltonto.github.io/ColtonsPortfolio/

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this portfolio.

- My motivation for this was to make a portfolio of work I've done that stands out.

- I built this portfolio because I really wanted a unique way to showcase all of the work I've done in learning to be a 
web developer. 

- What makes this portfolio of mine stand out is how organized it is. Through the use of neat styling and well used semantics in 
HTML, it should be a breeze for the user to pick apart and digest. It is also accessible on mobile devices!
